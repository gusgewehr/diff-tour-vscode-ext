# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-11-03)

**Core value:** A reviewer can walk an LLM-written tour of a git change inside VS Code, and every piece of code the tour points to opens read-only, side by side, at the exact commit the tour talks about.
**Current focus:** Milestone complete

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 8 (flow bar)
Plan: Not started
Status: Milestone complete
Last activity: 2026-11-04

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 20
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 2 | 3 | - | - |
| 3 | 1 | - | - |
| 4 | 3 | - | - |
| 5 | 3 | - | - |
| 8 | 1 | - | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Fork the diff-tour CLI for headless JSON/JSONL output
- Phase 1 verifies the CLI and schema before any extension code depends on it
- Claude Code is the only provider tested in v1; VSIX distribution only
- Flow nodes: fork adds optional file/lines to FlowNode (prompt v7); heuristic mapping only 15%
- Extension owns tour cache under globalStorageUri; the CLI `done` event carries key, path, SHAs

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phases 1, 4, 6, 8 need deeper research/spikes (see ROADMAP.md)
- Go 1.27.2 toolchain not yet verified locally (local Go 1.26.1)
- Upstream CLI untested on Windows; cancel must kill the process tree
- Flow node -> file mapping has no upstream data source (decided in CLI-07)
